# 2022 Food Crisis Dashboard
First dashboard that i've made using streamlit to visualize Food Price Crisis caused by Ukraine-Russia War (2022) and comparing it with Food Price Crisis 2007-2008.

* Region per country came from [UNICEF 2017 Regional Classification](https://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/JME-regional-classifications-15May-2017.xlsx)

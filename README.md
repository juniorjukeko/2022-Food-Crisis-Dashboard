# 2022 Food Crisis Dashboard
First dashboard that i've made using streamlit and plotly to visualize Food Price Crisis caused by the first 6 months since Ukraine-Russia War (2022) and comparing it with Food Price Crisis during 2007-2008.<br>
[App Link](https://juniorjukeko-2022-food-crisis-dashboard-dashboard-2nn7ad.streamlitapp.com/)

* Region per country came from [UNICEF 2017 Regional Classification](https://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/JME-regional-classifications-15May-2017.xlsx)

To run it locally, put project files into one directory and run this command into cmd from that directory. <br>
[Running cmd on a certain directory](https://stackoverflow.com/a/23320681)<br>
```
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

NB : The data used is local (not automatically-updated)
